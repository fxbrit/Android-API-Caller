# Android-API-Caller
Classes that allow for POST and GET requests in Android.

Born to understand how to use com.loopj.android.http.* to perform HTTP requests and handle the responses.
Data coming as response is logged. Callback can be used to handle different actions based on the content of the response.

You can copy the files in your project and edit the URLs, the parameters and the name of the fields in the response to have a fully functional way to make requests and handle responses. You just have to change the package name and import loopj packages.
